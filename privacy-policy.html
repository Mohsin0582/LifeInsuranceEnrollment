                    <h2>Life Insurance Enrollment Privacy Policy</h2>
                    <p>
                        This website is owned and operated by Lifeinsuranceenrollment.com Services, Inc. (&ldquo;Lifeinsuranceenrollment.com&rdquo;). This Privacy Policy (the "Policy") describes our practices in connection with Personally Identifiable Information that we collect through our website located at <a href="index.html">www.lifeinsuranceenrollment.com</a> (collectively, the "Site"). The terms of this Policy apply only to residents of the United States. You may be accessing our Site from a computer or mobile phone device (through an iPhone or iPad application, for example) and this Privacy Policy governs your use of our Site regardless of the means of access. We also like to interact with you on third party sites where we post content or invite your feedback, including sites such as www.facebook.com, www.twitter.com, www.pinterest.com and www.youtube.com (&ldquo;Third Party Sites&rdquo;). This Privacy Policy covers all collection, use and disclosure of Personally Identifiable Information, whether through the Site or otherwise.
                    </p>
                    <p>This Policy is effective as of the date indicated above. By using the Site, you agree to the terms of this Policy, as well as the Terms of Use located <a href="terms-of-use.html">here</a>. If you do not agree to the terms of this Policy and/or the Terms of Use, please do not use the Site. We may update this Policy from time to time and invite you to review this page periodically. In the event this Policy changes, we will inform you by posting an updated Policy on this web page. All changes will go into effect on the date that they are posted in our Policy. Use of the Site following such changes constitutes your acceptance of the revised Policy then in effect. If this Policy is construed as an offer, acceptance is limited expressly to the terms and conditions stated herein. To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, the new Policy will apply to all past and current users of the Site and will replace any prior Policies.</p>
                    <p>Note Regarding the Use of the Site by Persons Under Age 18: The Site is not directed to individuals under the age of eighteen (18), and we request that such individuals not provide Personally Identifiable Information through the Site. If you are under 18 years of age, you may browse our Site; however, you may not provide PII to us such as registering or making a purchase. If we discover that a person under the age of 18 has registered on the Site, we will delete such registration. If you are under 18 and want to make a purchase, please ask a parent or guardian to place the order for you.</p>
                    <p>This Privacy Notice outlines our information sharing practices to help you understand how we protect your privacy, when we collect and use information about you, and the measures we take to safeguard that information.</p>

                        <strong>
                            <u>COLLECTION OF INFORMATION</u>
                        </strong>
                    </p>
                    <p>Lifeinsuranceenrollment.com.com collects two basic types of information through the Site: "Personally Identifiable Information" ("PII") and "Non-Personally Identifiable Information" ("Non-PII") (collectively, "Personal Information"). Personally Identifiable Information is information that identifies you as an individual. Non-Personally Identifiable Information is aggregated information, demographic information, IP addresses and any other information that does not reveal your specific identity.</p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Personally Identifiable Information: </strong>We collect PII about you in order to place insurance on your behalf or provide other products or services. The categories of PII that we collect about you may be from the following sources:
                    </p>
                    <p>Information we receive from you on applications, forms, and questionnaires, including, but not limited , your occupation, current employer, address, birth date, marital status, driver&rsquo;s license number, social security number, driving record, and health conditions; and</p>
                    <p>Information about your transactions with us, our affiliates, or previous insurers, such as your policy coverage, claims information, premiums, and payment history.</p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Non-Personally Identifiable Information: </strong>When you visit and interact with the Site, Lifeinsuranceenrollment.com.com and third parties with whom we have contracted to provide services may collect Non-PII such as a catalog of the Site pages you visit. Non-PII is generally collected through the Site from five different sources: server log files, environmental variables, cookies, web beacons and other similar technologies and information that you voluntarily provide.
                    </p>
                    <ol type="A">
                        <li><strong> Server Log Files.</strong> Your Internet Protocol (IP) address is a number that is automatically assigned to the computer that you are using by your Internet Service Provider (ISP). This number is identified and logged automatically in our server log files whenever you visit the Site, along with the time(s) of your visit(s) and the page(s) that you visited, as well as information about the websites visited before and after visiting the Site, the products and services viewed and links clicked on within the Site, information regarding your Internet Service Provider, and other standard server log information. We use your IP address, and the IP addresses of all users, for purposes such as calculating Site usage levels, helping diagnose problems with the Site's servers, and administering the Site. Collecting IP addresses is standard practice on the Internet and is done automatically by many websites. If you access the Site via a mobile device such as a smartphone, the collected information may also include your phone&rsquo;s unique device ID, location, and other similar mobile device data.</li>
                        <li><strong> Environmental Variables.</strong> We and our service providers may also collect certain environmental variables, such as your MAC address, computer type (Windows or Macintosh), screen resolution, OS version, Internet browser, and Internet browser version. These environmental variables are collected by most browsers, and can be used to optimize your experience on the Site.</li>
                        <li><strong> Cookies. </strong>We and our service providers may use "cookies" on the Site. Cookies are data that a web server transfers to an individual's computer for recordkeeping purposes. Cookies are an industry standard used by most websites, and can facilitate users' ongoing access to and use of a particular website; cookies do not cause damage to your computer systems or files. If you do not want information collected through the use of cookies, there is a simple procedure in most browsers that allows you to automatically decline cookies, or to be given the choice of declining or accepting the transfer of a particular cookie, or cookies from a particular website, to your computer. Please note that if you disable cookies, certain aspects of the Site may not function properly.</li>
                        <li><strong> Web Beacons.</strong> We and our service providers may also use so-called "web beacons," "pixel tags," "clear GIFs" or similar means (collectively, "Web Beacons") in connection with some Site pages and HTML-formatted e-mail messages to, among other things, compile aggregate statistics about Site usage and response rates. A Web Beacon is an electronic image, often a single pixel (1x1), that is ordinarily not visible to Site visitors and may be associated with Cookies on the visitors' hard drives. Web Beacons allow us to count users who have visited certain pages of the Site, to deliver branded services, to serve ads, and to help determine the effectiveness of promotional or advertising campaigns. When used in HTML-formatted e-mail messages, Web Beacons can tell the sender whether and when the e-mail has been opened.</li>
                        <li><strong> Information That You Voluntarily Provide.</strong> We may also collect Non-PII (e.g., your geographic location, etc.) when you voluntarily provide such information to us. When such information is not combined with any PII, such information is considered to be Non-PII, as it does not personally identify you or any other user.</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>Additionally, we may aggregate PII in a manner such that the end-product does not personally identify you or any other user of the Site, for example, by using PII to calculate the percentage of our users who have a particular telephone area code. Such aggregate information is considered Non-PII for purposes of this Policy. Please note that if we combine any Non-PII with PII, the combined information will be treated by us as PII as long as it is so combined.</p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>
                            <u>USE OF COLLECTED INFORMATION</u>
                        </strong>
                    </p>
                    <p>The information you provide is used for internal purposes, such as confirming and tracking any website transactions or otherwise as described in this privacy policy. We may also contact you via email, text or regular mail from time-to-time to keep you up-to-date on the latest Lifeinsuranceenrollment.com news. Also, to the extent permitted by state or federal law, we may share your email or postal address with our affiliated companies that we think may be of interest to you. If you would like to opt out of receiving mailings from Lifeinsuranceenrollment.com, please contact us at the phone number and/or e-mail address listed below under the &ldquo;UPDATING, DELETING, EDITING YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION&rdquo; heading.</p>
                    <p>Notwithstanding any other provision of this Policy to the contrary, we reserve the right to disclose PII and/or Non-PII to others as we believe appropriate (a) to comply with legal process; (b) to respond to governmental requests; (c) to enforce our Terms of Use; (d) to protect the rights, privacy, safety or property of Lifeinsuranceenrollment.com, you or others; and (e) to permit us to pursue available remedies or limit the damages that we may sustain. We may disclose any information, including PII, we deem necessary, in our sole discretion, to comply with any applicable law, regulation, legal process or governmental request. We may also exchange information, including PII, with other companies and organizations for credit fraud protection, risk reduction, and to address cyber security risks and/or data breaches. In the event of a merger, reorganization, sale, joint venture, consolidation or sale or transfer of all or substantially all of our company, its stock, or its assets (including without limitation in connection with any bankruptcy or similar proceedings), it is possible that all User information collected by Lifeinsuranceenrollment.com will be transferred to the purchaser or the new company. Because Non-PII does not personally identify you, we may use such information for any purpose. In addition, we reserve the right to share such Non-PII with other third parties, for any purpose.</p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Data Retention</strong>: We will retain your Personal Information for the period necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this Policy unless a longer retention period is required or allowed by law.
                    </p>

                    </p>
                    <p>We do not disclose PII we collect about you, as described above, to nonaffiliated companies to market products or services to you. However, we work with third parties who provide services including but not limited to website operation, payment processing and authorization, data analysis, transaction processing and fulfillment, client support, list enhancement and other administrative services. We may share PII with such third parties for the purpose of enabling these third parties to provide services to us. Such service providers may include client support specialists, webhosting companies, client data management and enhancement companies, payment processors, fulfillment companies (e.g., companies that process transactions or coordinate mailings), data analysis firms and email service providers. Such third parties may be provided with access to PII needed to perform their functions, but may not use such information for any other purpose. Our employees and service providers may be located in foreign jurisdictions, and your personal information may be subject to the laws of those foreign jurisdictions and/or accessible to law enforcement and other authorities.</p>

Your PII and Non-PII may be stored, transferred to, and processed in any country where we have facilities or in which we engage service providers, and by using our products and services, you consent to the processing and transfer of information to countries outside of your country of residence, including the United States, which may have different data protection rules than in your country. Lifeinsuranceenrollment.com does not represent or warrant that the Site, or any part thereof, is appropriate or available for use in any particular jurisdiction. Those who choose to access the Site do so on their own initiative and at their own risk, and are responsible for complying with all local laws, rules and regulations.

Lifeinsuranceenrollment.com also uses Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) technology. SSL encrypts the data submitted to our Site so that only we can decode your information, so long as SSL is supported by your web browser and enabled when your information is submitted. Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet or data storage system can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. If you have reason to believe that your interaction with us is no longer secure (for example, if you feel that the security of your account has been compromised), please notify us of the problem as soon as possible by contacting us at the phone number and/or e-mail address listed above. To safeguard your privacy, we need your help. When registering an account on the Site, please be sure to choose an account password that is difficult for others to guess, preferably a password you do not use on any other website or account, and never reveal it to anyone else. If you use a shared or public computer, DO NOT choose to have your login ID or password remembered and be sure to log out of your account completely every time you leave the computer. Also, please verify that your web browser has a secure connection to the Site before entering any PII and avoid including personally identifying information in e-mails to us (particularly credit card or banking information).</p>

                    <p>Some browsers or other tools include "Do Not Track" (DNT) features which, when turned on, send a signal to websites you visit indicating that you do not wish to be tracked across websites over time. The Worldwide Web Consortium (W3C) has been working with industry groups and regulators to develop a DNT browser technology standard to provide a common understanding as to how to interpret the DNT signals. As of the date of publication of this Privacy Policy, no standard had been adopted and fully implemented and accordingly Lifeinsuranceenrollment.com does not currently respond to DNT signals. As the DNT standard develops, Lifeinsuranceenrollment.com reserves the right to modify the Policy in response.
